// // Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods). OOP emphasizes the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit or class. Inheritance allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing ones, promoting code reuse. Polymorphism enables methods to process objects differently based on their data type or class. OOP enhances code modularity, readability, and maintainability.
