//Synchronous code
- The code that runs line by line is called synchronous code.



There are two Queue's
1- CallStack
2- Callback Queue's


//Asynchronous code
1) The code which is not directly enterned into callstack is called Async Code.

2) Async is directly entered into webapi like settimeoute and then it goes to callbackstack and then 
with the help of event loop it is sent to the callstack.   

3) Async code is sent to callback Queue because it will stop the execution of the entire program. That's why it is 
sent to callback queue.
